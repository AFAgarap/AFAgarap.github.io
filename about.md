Hello! My name is Abien Fred Agarap and I am currently a Master of Science in Computer Science student at De La Salle University - Manila, where I am currently being advised by Dr. Arnulfo P. Azcarraga.

My research interests are the foundations of deep learning, game theory for deep learning, representation learning, and interpretability of machine learning. 

You can know a bit more about me below. If you are interested in communicating with me, my e-mail address is abienfred.agarap[at]gmail.com. Thank you for visiting!

**Improving k-Means Clustering Performance with Disentangled Internal
Representations**

Abien Fred Agarap, Arnulfo P. Azcarraga (IJCNN 2020)

**Abstract:** Deep clustering algorithms combine representation learning and clustering by jointly optimizing a clustering loss and a non-clustering loss. In such methods, a deep neural network is used for representation learning together with a clustering network. Instead of following this framework to improve clustering performance, we propose a simpler approach of optimizing the entanglement of the learned latent code representation of an autoencoder. We define entanglement as how close pairs of points from the same class or structure are, relative to pairs of points from different classes or structures. To measure the entanglement of data points, we use the soft nearest neighbor loss, and expand it by introducing an annealing temperature factor. Using our proposed approach, the test clustering accuracy was 96.2% on the MNIST dataset, 85.6% on the Fashion-MNIST dataset, and 79.2% on the EMNIST Balanced dataset, outperforming our baseline models.<br>**Link:** [arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04535)
